### Chaos Engineering with LitmusChaos on Amazon EKS


As organizations are embracing microservices-based architectures by refactoring large monolith applications into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled services. These independent services are faster to deploy and scale, enabling organizations to innovate and deliver faster. Nevertheless,as the application grows, these microservices present their own challenges. 

For example, as you deploy tens or hundreds or thousands of microservices, operational tasks such as distributed tracing, debugging, testing, dependency mapping, and so on, become challenging. 

To address these challenges, organizations are increasingly practicing Chaos Engineering to test the reliability and performance of distributed systems.
